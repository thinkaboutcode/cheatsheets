    "## **1. Introduction to Probability**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Lesson 1: What is Probability?**\n",
    "Probability is the branch of mathematics that deals with uncertainty. It quantifies the likelihood of events occurring in the future based on known data or experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Concepts**:\n",
    "  - **Experiment**: A process that produces an outcome (e.g., flipping a coin).\n",
    "  - **Outcome**: A possible result of an experiment (e.g., heads or tails).\n",
    "  - **Event**: A set of one or more outcomes (e.g., getting heads).\n",
    "  - **Probability**: A measure of the likelihood of an event, represented by a value between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Lesson 2: The Classical Definition of Probability**\n",
    "In simple situations, probability is calculated as:\n",
    "\n    P(A) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**: If you roll a fair six-sided die, the probability of rolling a 4 is:\n",
    "\n    P(4) = 1/6\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Lesson 3: The Axioms of Probability (Kolmogorov Axioms)**\n",
    "Probability is built on three key axioms:\n",
    "1. **Non-negativity**: P(A) ≥ 0 for any event A.\n",
    "2. **Normalization**: P(Ω) = 1 (where Ω is the sample space).\n",
    "3. **Additivity**: For mutually exclusive events, P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Probability Rules and Theorems**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Lesson 1: Addition Rule**\n",
    "- **For Mutually Exclusive Events**: P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B)\n",
    "- **For Non-Mutually Exclusive Events**: P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**: What is the probability of rolling a 1 or a 6 on a fair die?\n",
    "  - P(1 ∪ 6) = 1/6 + 1/6 = 2/6 = 1/3\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Lesson 2: Multiplication Rule**\n",
    "- **For Independent Events**: P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B)\n",
    "- **For Dependent Events**: P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B | A)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**: If you flip a fair coin twice, the probability of getting heads on both flips is:\n",
    "  - P(H ∩ H) = P(H) × P(H) = 1/2 × 1/2 = 1/4\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Lesson 3: Complementary Rule**\n",
    "The probability that an event does not happen is:\n",
    "\n    P(not A) = 1 - P(A)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**: If the probability of rain tomorrow is 0.3, the probability of no rain is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Conditional Probability**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Lesson 1: Definition of Conditional Probability**\n",
    "Conditional probability is the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred:\n",
    "\n    P(A | B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**: If you draw two cards from a deck and the first card is an ace, the probability that the second card is also an ace (without replacement) is:\n",
    "  - P(Ace 2 | Ace 1) = 3/51\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Lesson 2: Law of Total Probability**\n",
    "If B1, B2, ..., Bn are mutually exclusive and exhaustive events, then:\n",
    "\n    P(A) = P(A ∩ B1) + P(A ∩ B2) + ... + P(A ∩ Bn)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Lesson 3: Bayes' Theorem**\n",
    "Bayes' Theorem allows us to update probabilities based on new evidence:\n",
    "\n    P(A | B) = P(B | A) * P(A) / P(B)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**: In medical testing, Bayes' Theorem can be used to determine the probability of having a disease given a positive test result, accounting for the test's accuracy.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Lesson 4: Probability Density Function (PDF)**\n",
    "The PDF describes the likelihood of a continuous random variable taking on a particular value. The probability that X lies within an interval [a, b] is given by the area under the PDF curve:\n",
