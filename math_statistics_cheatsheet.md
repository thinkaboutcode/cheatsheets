## 1. Introduction to Statistics

### Lesson 1: What is Statistics?
Statistics is the science of collecting, analyzing, interpreting, presenting, and organizing data. It helps in making decisions based on data and supports conclusions drawn from empirical research. It’s widely used in fields like business, economics, healthcare, and social sciences.

### Lesson 2: Types of Statistics
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Deals with the summarization and organization of data. For example, calculating the average salary in a company.
- **Inferential Statistics**: Makes predictions or inferences about a population based on a sample of data. For example, using a survey to predict election results.

### Lesson 3: Applications of Statistics
Statistics is essential in fields like:
- **Business**: Forecasting sales, managing inventory.
- **Healthcare**: Analyzing the effectiveness of treatments.
- **Social Sciences**: Understanding social behavior through surveys.

### Lesson 4: Basic Terminology
- **Population**: The entire group being studied.
- **Sample**: A subset of the population.
- **Variable**: A characteristic measured in the study (e.g., height, weight).
- **Parameter**: A numerical summary of a population.
- **Statistic**: A numerical summary of a sample.

## 2. Data Collection and Sampling

### Lesson 1: Types of Data
- **Quantitative Data**: Numerical data, like income or age.
- **Qualitative Data**: Categorical data, like gender or ethnicity.
- **Continuous Data**: Can take any value within a range (e.g., height, temperature).

### Lesson 2: Data Collection Methods
- **Surveys**: Questionnaires used to collect data from a sample.
- **Experiments**: Controlled studies where variables are manipulated.
- **Observational Studies**: Observing subjects without intervention.

### Lesson 3: Sampling Techniques
- **Random Sampling**: Each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected.
- **Stratified Sampling**: The population is divided into subgroups (strata) and samples are taken from each.
- **Cluster Sampling**: The population is divided into clusters, and some clusters are randomly selected for study.
- **Systematic Sampling**: Every nth member of the population is selected.

### Lesson 4: Bias and Errors in Sampling
- **Sampling Bias**: When some members of the population are more likely to be chosen.
- **Non-sampling Errors**: Mistakes that occur during data collection (e.g., measurement error, non-response bias).

## 3. Descriptive Statistics

### Lesson 1: Measures of Central Tendency
- **Mean**: The arithmetic average of a data set.
- **Median**: The middle value in a data set when ordered.
- **Mode**: The most frequent value in a data set.

### Lesson 2: Measures of Dispersion
- **Range**: Difference between the highest and lowest values.
- **Variance**: The average of squared deviations from the mean.
- **Standard Deviation**: A measure of how spread out the data is.
- **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: The difference between the third and first quartiles, capturing the middle 50% of data.

### Lesson 3: Shape of Distributions
- **Symmetry**: A distribution where the left and right sides mirror each other.
- **Skewness**: Indicates whether data is skewed to the left or right.
- **Kurtosis**: Measures the "tailedness" of a distribution; higher kurtosis means more extreme outliers.

## 5. Probability Theory

### Lesson 1: Basic Probability Concepts
- **Experiment**: A process that leads to an outcome (e.g., flipping a coin).
- **Outcome**: The result of an experiment (e.g., heads or tails).
- **Event**: A set of outcomes (e.g., getting heads).
- **Sample Space**: All possible outcomes (e.g., heads and tails).

### Lesson 2: Rules of Probability
- **Addition Rule**: Probability of A or B happening is P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B).
- **Multiplication Rule**: Probability of A and B happening is P(A) * P(B | A).
- **Conditional Probability**: The probability of A given B has occurred, P(A | B).

### Lesson 3: Bayes’ Theorem
Bayes' Theorem updates the probability of an event based on new evidence. It's crucial in areas like medical diagnostics and machine learning.

## 6. Random Variables and Probability Distributions

### Lesson 1: Definition of Random Variables
- **Discrete Random Variables**: Take distinct values (e.g., number of students in a class).
- **Continuous Random Variables**: Take any value within a range (e.g., temperature).

### Lesson 2: Probability Distribution Functions (PDFs)
- **PMF (Probability Mass Function)**: Used for discrete variables; gives the probability of each possible value.
- **PDF (Probability Density Function)**: Used for continuous variables; describes the probability of a variable falling within a range.

### Lesson 3: Key Distributions
- **Binomial Distribution**: For binary outcomes (success/failure).
- **Normal Distribution**: A bell-shaped curve, often occurring in nature.
- **Poisson Distribution**: For counting occurrences of events in fixed intervals.
- **Uniform Distribution**: All outcomes are equally likely.
- **Exponential Distribution**: Describes the time between events in a Poisson process.

## 7. Sampling Distributions and the Central Limit Theorem

### Lesson 1: Sampling Distribution
The sampling distribution shows the distribution of sample means. It becomes crucial when making inferences about the population.

### Lesson 2: Central Limit Theorem (CLT)
The CLT states that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the population's distribution.

### Lesson 3: Standard Error
The standard error measures how much sample means deviate from the population mean. It decreases as the sample size increases.

### Lesson 4: Law of Large Numbers
As the number of trials increases, the sample mean will converge to the population mean.

## 8. Hypothesis Testing

### Lesson 1: Concept of Hypothesis Testing
- **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: Assumes no effect or difference.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: Assumes there is an effect or difference.

### Lesson 2: P-values and Statistical Significance
The **p-value** is the probability of observing data as extreme as the data observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true. If the p-value is below a chosen threshold (e.g., 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis.

### Lesson 3: Test Statistics
- **Z-Test**: Used when the population variance is known.
- **T-Test**: Used when the population variance is unknown and sample size is small.
- **Chi-square Test**: Tests the association between categorical variables.
- **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)**: Compares means across three or more groups.

### Lesson 4: One-tailed vs Two-tailed Tests
A **one-tailed test** looks for a difference in one direction, while a **two-tailed test** looks for differences in both directions.

## 9. Confidence Intervals

### Lesson 1: Definition and Interpretation of Confidence Intervals
A confidence interval provides a range of values within which the true population parameter is likely to lie, with a certain level of confidence (e.g., 95%).

### Lesson 2: Constructing Confidence Intervals
- **For Population Mean**: Based on sample mean, standard deviation, and sample size.
- **For Proportions**: Used when working with binary data (e.g., success/failure).
- **For Differences Between Two Means**: Used to compare two different groups.

### Lesson 3: Margin of Error
The margin of error is the range of uncertainty in your confidence interval, influenced by sample size and variability in the data.

## 10. Correlation and Regression

### Lesson 1: Correlation
- **Pearson Correlation Coefficient**: Measures the linear relationship between two variables.
- **Spearman Rank Correlation**: Measures the strength and direction of the relationship between ranked variables.

### Lesson 2: Simple Linear Regression
- **Regression Equation**: Describes the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variable (y = mx + b).
- **Slope and Intercept**: The slope represents the change in y for a one-unit change in x.
- **Coefficient of Determination (R²)**: Represents the proportion of variation in the dependent variable explained by the independent variable.

### Lesson 3: Multiple Regression Analysis
- **Model Assumptions**: Linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, and normality of residuals.
- **Multicollinearity**: When independent variables are highly correlated with each other, potentially distorting the results.
