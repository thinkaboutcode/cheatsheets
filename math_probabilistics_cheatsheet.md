# Probabilistics Course Outline

---

## **1. Introduction to Probability**

### **Lesson 1: What is Probability?**
Probability is the branch of mathematics that deals with uncertainty. It quantifies the likelihood of events occurring in the future based on known data or experiments.

- **Key Concepts**:
 - **Experiment**: A process that produces an outcome (e.g., flipping a coin).
 - **Outcome**: A possible result of an experiment (e.g., heads or tails).
 - **Event**: A set of one or more outcomes (e.g., getting heads).
 - **Probability**: A measure of the likelihood of an event, represented by a value between 0 and 1.

### **Lesson 2: The Classical Definition of Probability**
In simple situations, probability is calculated as:

\[
P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}}
\]

- **Example**: If you roll a fair six-sided die, the probability of rolling a 4 is:

\[
P(4) = \frac{1}{6}
\]

### **Lesson 3: The Axioms of Probability (Kolmogorov Axioms)**
Probability is built on three key axioms:
1. **Non-negativity**: \( P(A) \geq 0 \) for any event A.
2. **Normalization**: \( P(\Omega) = 1 \) (where \( \Omega \) is the sample space).
3. **Additivity**: For mutually exclusive events, \( P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) \).

---

## **2. Probability Rules and Theorems**

### **Lesson 1: Addition Rule**
- **For Mutually Exclusive Events**: \( P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) \)
- **For Non-Mutually Exclusive Events**: \( P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) \)

- **Example**: What is the probability of rolling a 1 or a 6 on a fair die?
 - \( P(1 \cup 6) = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3} \)

### **Lesson 2: Multiplication Rule**
- **For Independent Events**: \( P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B) \)
- **For Dependent Events**: \( P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B | A) \)

- **Example**: If you flip a fair coin twice, the probability of getting heads on both flips is:
 - \( P(H \cap H) = P(H) \times P(H) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} \)

### **Lesson 3: Complementary Rule**
The probability that an event does not happen is:

\[
P(\text{not A}) = 1 - P(A)
\]

- **Example**: If the probability of rain tomorrow is 0.3, the probability of no rain is \( 1 - 0.3 = 0.7 \).

---

## **3. Conditional Probability**

### **Lesson 1: Definition of Conditional Probability**
Conditional probability is the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred:

\[
P(A | B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
\]

- **Example**: If you draw two cards from a deck and the first card is an ace, the probability that the second card is also an ace (without replacement) is:

\[
P(\text{Ace 2} | \text{Ace 1}) = \frac{3}{51}
\]

### **Lesson 2: Law of Total Probability**
If \( B_1, B_2, \dots, B_n \) are mutually exclusive and exhaustive events, then:

\[
P(A) = P(A \cap B_1) + P(A \cap B_2) + \dots + P(A \cap B_n)
\]

### **Lesson 3: Bayes' Theorem**
Bayes' Theorem allows us to update probabilities based on new evidence:

\[
P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

- **Example**: In medical testing, Bayes' Theorem can be used to determine the probability of having a disease given a positive test result, accounting for the test's accuracy.

---

## **4. Discrete and Continuous Random Variables**

### **Lesson 1: Discrete Random Variables**
A discrete random variable takes on a countable number of possible values.

- **Example**: The number of heads in three coin flips is a discrete random variable with possible values 0, 1, 2, or 3.

### **Lesson 2: Probability Mass Function (PMF)**
The PMF gives the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to some value:

\[
P(X = x)
\]

- **Example**: If \( X \) is the outcome of rolling a six-sided die, then \( P(X = 4) = \frac{1}{6} \).

### **Lesson 3: Continuous Random Variables**
A continuous random variable takes on an infinite number of possible values within a range.

- **Example**: The time a randomly chosen student takes to complete an exam is a continuous random variable.

### **Lesson 4: Probability Density Function (PDF)**
The PDF describes the likelihood of a continuous random variable taking on a particular value. The probability that \( X \) lies within an interval \( [a, b] \) is given by the area under the PDF curve:

\[
P(a \leq X \leq b) = \int_a^b f(x) dx
\]

---

## **5. Expectation, Variance, and Moments**

### **Lesson 1: Expected Value (Mean)**
The expected value \( E[X] \) is the long-run average value of a random variable:

\[
E[X] = \sum_{i} x_i \cdot P(X = x_i)
\]

For continuous variables:

\[
E[X] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x f(x) dx
\]

### **Lesson 2: Variance and Standard Deviation**
Variance measures the spread of a random variable:

\[
\text{Var}(X) = E[(X - E[X])^2]
\]

Standard deviation is the square root of the variance, representing the average deviation from the mean.

### **Lesson 3: Covariance and Correlation**
Covariance measures the degree to which two random variables change together:

\[
\text{Cov}(X, Y) = E[(X - E[X]) (Y - E[Y])]
\]

Correlation normalizes covariance to provide a dimensionless measure of association:

\[
\rho(X, Y) = \frac{\text{Cov}(X, Y)}{\sigma_X \sigma_Y}
\]

---

## **6. Common Probability Distributions**

### **Lesson 1: Discrete Distributions**
- **Bernoulli Distribution**: Models a single trial with two possible outcomes (success/failure).
- **Binomial Distribution**: Models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials.
- **Poisson Distribution**: Models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space.

### **Lesson 2: Continuous Distributions**
- **Uniform Distribution**: All outcomes in a range are equally likely.
- **Normal Distribution**: The famous "bell curve," which models many natural phenomena.
- **Exponential Distribution**: Models the time between events in a Poisson process.

---

## **7. Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem**

### **Lesson 1: Law of Large Numbers**
As the number of trials increases, the sample mean converges to the population mean:

\[
\lim_{n \to \infty} \bar{X_n} = \mu
\]

### **Lesson 2: Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**
The CLT states that the sum (or mean) of a large number of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables approximately follows a normal distribution, regardless of the original distribution of the variables.

- **Example**: The average height of a large sample of people will be normally distributed, even if individual heights are not.

---

## **8. Joint Distributions and Independence**

### **Lesson 1: Joint Probability Distributions**
The joint distribution describes the probability of two or more random variables occurring simultaneously:

\[
P(X = x, Y = y)
\]

For continuous variables, the joint PDF is:

\[
f(x, y) = \frac{\partial^2 F(x, y)}{\partial x \partial y}
\]

### **Lesson 2: Marginal Distributions**
The marginal distribution of \( X \) is found by summing (or integrating) over the values of \( Y \):

\[
P(X = x) = \sum_{y} P(X = x, Y = y)
\]

### **Lesson 3: Independence**
Two random variables \( X \) and \( Y \) are independent if:

\[
P(X = x, Y = y) = P(X = x) \cdot P(Y = y)
\]

---

## **9. Markov Chains and Stochastic Processes**

### **Lesson 1: Markov Property**
A stochastic process has the Markov property if the future state depends only on the current state, not the past states:

\[
P(X_{n+1} = x | X_n = x_n, X_{n-1} = x_{n-1}, \dots) = P(X_{n+1} = x | X_n = x_n)
\]

### **Lesson 2: Transition Matrices**
The probability of moving from one state to another in a Markov chain is described by a transition matrix.

---

## **10. Bayesian Probability**

### **Lesson 1: Bayesian Inference**
Bayesian inference updates the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence using Bayesâ€™ theorem:

\[
P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

- **Example**: Bayesian updating in a clinical trial to estimate the effectiveness of a new drug.

---

## **11. Advanced Topics in Probability (Optional)**

### **Lesson 1: Monte Carlo Simulations**
Monte Carlo methods use random sampling to approximate complex probability distributions.

### **Lesson 2: Continuous-Time Markov Chains**
An extension of discrete-time Markov chains, used to model systems that evolve continuously over time.

### **Lesson 3: Queueing Theory**
Models the behavior of queues, such as customer service lines or network packet queues, using probability.
