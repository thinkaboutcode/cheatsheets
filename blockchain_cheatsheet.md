### Major Concepts of Blockchain

1. **Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)**
    - Blockchain operates as a decentralized, distributed ledger where all participants in the network have access to a shared copy of the data.
    - There is no central authority controlling the ledger, which enhances transparency and security.

2. **Blocks**
    - A **block** contains a set of transactions that are recorded and stored together.
    - Each block is linked to the previous one, forming a **chain** of blocks, hence the term “blockchain.”
    - A block typically contains a **timestamp**, a **list of transactions**, and a **hash** (a unique identifier).

3. **Decentralization**
    - Unlike traditional centralized systems, blockchain does not rely on a single entity for validation and record-keeping.
    - The decentralized nature means that multiple participants (called nodes) validate transactions across the network, ensuring integrity.

4. **Cryptographic Hashing**
    - Blockchain uses cryptographic hashing algorithms (e.g., SHA-256) to secure data.
    - Each block is hashed to ensure data integrity. Any change to a block's data would alter its hash, making it immediately noticeable and preventing tampering.

5. **Consensus Mechanisms**
    - Consensus mechanisms are protocols used to agree upon the validity of transactions on the network.
    - Common consensus mechanisms include **Proof of Work (PoW)**, **Proof of Stake (PoS)**, **Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)**, and **Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)**.

6. **Smart Contracts**
    - **Smart contracts** are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into lines of code.
    - They automatically execute and enforce the terms of a contract when certain conditions are met, reducing the need for intermediaries.

7. **Public vs. Private Blockchains**
    - **Public blockchains** are open to anyone and do not require permission to join (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum).
    - **Private blockchains** are permissioned, meaning that only selected participants can join and validate transactions.

8. **Tokens and Cryptocurrencies**
    - **Tokens** are digital assets built on blockchain platforms, often representing value or a utility within a specific ecosystem.
    - Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are the most common example of tokens, acting as mediums of exchange, stores of value, or representations of assets.

9. **Mining and Validators**
    - **Mining** refers to the process of validating transactions and adding them to the blockchain in PoW-based blockchains, where miners solve complex mathematical problems.
    - **Validators** are participants in PoS or other consensus models that confirm transactions and add them to the blockchain.

10. **Immutability**
- Once a transaction is added to the blockchain, it is nearly impossible to alter or remove. This ensures that records are permanent and auditable.

11. **Transparency**
- Blockchain offers high transparency, as all transactions are visible to everyone in the network, and records cannot be easily changed.

12. **Security**
- Blockchain’s decentralized nature, combined with cryptographic methods, makes it highly secure against fraud, hacking, and unauthorized changes.
