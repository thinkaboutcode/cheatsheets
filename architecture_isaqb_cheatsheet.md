# iSAQB - International Software Architecture Qualification Board

The **iSAQB** is a global initiative to promote the professionalization of software architecture. It provides a standardized qualification framework for software architects and helps in defining key concepts and practices in software architecture.

---

## 1. Software Architecture Fundamentals
- **Definition**: Software architecture is the structure of a software system, comprising software elements, their relationships, and the principles governing their design and evolution.
- **Goals**:
    - Ensure quality attributes (e.g., performance, security, maintainability).
    - Provide a blueprint for stakeholders.
    - Facilitate communication and understanding across teams.

---

## 2. Architecture Views
- **Purpose**: Different stakeholders require different perspectives on the architecture.
- **Key Views**:
    - **Logical View**: Focuses on the functionality of the system, showing how components interact to provide services.
    - **Development View**: Explains the organization of the software in terms of modules and layers.
    - **Physical View**: Describes the hardware and software infrastructure, including deployment diagrams.
    - **Process View**: Captures dynamic behavior, including the interactions and workflows of the system during execution.

---

## 3. Quality Attributes
- **Definition**: Non-functional requirements that impact the architecture and design of the system.
- **Common Quality Attributes**:
    - **Performance**: Speed and efficiency of the system.
    - **Scalability**: Ability to handle growth (e.g., user load).
    - **Security**: Protection against unauthorized access and vulnerabilities.
    - **Maintainability**: Ease of updates and modifications.
    - **Usability**: User-friendliness of the system.

---

## 4. Architectural Patterns and Styles
- **Purpose**: Reusable solutions to common architectural problems.
- **Common Patterns**:
    - **Layered Architecture**: Organizes the system into layers, each with specific responsibilities.
    - **Microservices**: Decomposes the application into small, loosely coupled services.
    - **Event-Driven Architecture**: Uses events to trigger actions and communicate between components.
    - **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**: Promotes the use of services to support interoperability between disparate systems.

---

## 5. Documentation and Communication
- **Importance**: Clear documentation and communication are essential for successful architecture implementation.
- **Best Practices**:
    - Use visual diagrams to represent architectural views.
    - Maintain architecture documentation that evolves with the system.
    - Foster collaboration among stakeholders to ensure alignment.

---

## 6. Qualification and Certification
- **iSAQB Certification**: A structured program for software architects, emphasizing practical skills and knowledge.
- **Levels**:
    - **Foundation Level**: Basic understanding of software architecture principles.
    - **Advanced Level**: In-depth knowledge of specialized areas and practical application.

---

### Key Principles of iSAQB
- **Stakeholder Focus**: Address the needs of various stakeholders (e.g., developers, business analysts, users).
- **Iterative Development**: Architecture should evolve through iterative processes, incorporating feedback and changes.
- **Continuous Learning**: Encourage ongoing professional development and knowledge sharing in the field of software architecture.
